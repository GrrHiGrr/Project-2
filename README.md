# Project-2

Our Aplication "NAME TBD" is designed to allow people with pets of all kinds, (or without pets), to meet, share and interact.

Users will sign up and create an account with our application, where their username and password would be stored.

They will be asked to upload a picture *TBD* and label their account according to what they are looking for. For example, Pet Owner, No Pet Lover, Breeder/Rescue, etc. This will help people better filter what they are looking for. 

Further integrations *TBD*: Breed? Location? etc.

Utilizing Weather API / Google API to help locate and plan meet-ups and more.
