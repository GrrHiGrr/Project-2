# Project-2

Our Aplication "LFP: LOOKING FOR PETS" is designed to allow people with pets of all kinds, (or without pets), to meet, share and interact.

Users will sign up and create an account with our application, where their username and password would be stored.

They will be asked to register a pet, as well as upload a picture, and //TBD- label their account according to what they are looking for. For example, Pet Owner, No Pet Lover, Breeder/Rescue, etc. This will help people better filter what they are looking for. //

Pet and user account information is stored in a database using MySQl and Sequelize ORM. Sensitive information is protected using environment variables. Authenticates sessions (with protected secret) and utilizes cookies.

RESTful API uses Node.js and Express.js

GET and POST routes are used to retrieve and add new data

Utilizes Tailwindcss for styling and Handlebars.js as the template engine.

Deployed at https://looking-for-pets.herokuapp.com/

Further development plans: 

Adding more pet information: breed ? etc.

Getting Cloudinary API up and running to allow users to upload pet photos

Utilizing Weather API / Google API to help locate and plan meet-ups, find local shelters /  adoption agencies, and more.
